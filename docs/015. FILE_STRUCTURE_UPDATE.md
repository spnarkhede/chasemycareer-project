# File Structure Update - Chase My Career

## 🎯 What Changed

The 50-day content has been **restructured from one large file into 50 separate files** for easier editing and management.

---

## 📁 Before vs After

### Before (Single File)
```
src/data/
└── jobSearchData.ts          # 1265 lines, all 50 days in one file
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Hard to find specific days (lots of scrolling)
- ❌ Difficult to edit (1265 lines of code)
- ❌ Merge conflicts when multiple people edit
- ❌ Hard to track changes in version control

### After (50 Separate Files)
```
src/data/
├── jobSearchData.ts          # 107 lines, imports all days
└── days/
    ├── day-01.ts             # ~40 lines per file
    ├── day-02.ts
    ├── day-03.ts
    ...
    ├── day-49.ts
    └── day-50.ts
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Easy to find any day (clear file names)
- ✅ Easy to edit (small, focused files)
- ✅ No merge conflicts (separate files)
- ✅ Clear change tracking in version control
- ✅ Better organization and maintainability

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Main Data File (`jobSearchData.ts`)
This file now imports all 50 day files and exports them as an array:

```typescript
import type { DayContent } from '@/types';

// Import all 50 day files
import { day01 } from './days/day-01';
import { day02 } from './days/day-02';
// ... (imports for all 50 days)

// Export all days as an array
export const jobSearchData: DayContent[] = [
  day01,
  day02,
  day03,
  // ... (all 50 days)
];
```

### Individual Day Files
Each day file exports a single day object:

```typescript
import type { DayContent } from '@/types';

export const day01: DayContent = {
  dayNumber: 1,
  theme: 'Resume: Build Your Wins Bank',
  objective: 'Create a comprehensive list of measurable achievements...',
  keyTasks: [...],
  instructions: [...],
  resources: [],
  timeCommitment: '2-3 hours',
  proTip: 'Focus on results, not responsibilities...',
};
```

---

## 📝 File Naming Convention

### File Names
- Format: `day-XX.ts` (where XX is 01-50)
- Examples: `day-01.ts`, `day-15.ts`, `day-50.ts`
- Always use **two digits** (01, not 1)

### Export Names
- Format: `dayXX` (where XX is 01-50)
- Examples: `day01`, `day15`, `day50`
- Always use **two digits** (day01, not day1)

---

## 🎯 Editing Workflow

### To Edit a Day

1. **Navigate to the day file**
   ```
   src/data/days/day-35.ts
   ```

2. **Open and edit the file**
   - Change theme, objective, tasks, etc.
   - Add detailed instructions
   - Include resources and tips

3. **Save the file**
   - Changes are automatically reflected
   - No need to edit any other files

4. **Test in the application**
   - Refresh the page
   - Navigate to the day you edited
   - Verify the content looks correct

### To Add Content to Days 31-50

Days 31-50 currently have placeholder content:

```typescript
export const day35: DayContent = {
  dayNumber: 35,
  theme: 'Day 35 - Content Coming Soon',
  objective: 'Content will be added soon.',
  keyTasks: ['Content to be added'],
  instructions: [{ title: 'Placeholder', steps: ['Content will be added soon'] }],
  resources: [],
  timeCommitment: 'TBD',
  proTip: 'Content coming soon!',
};
```

Simply replace the placeholder with your actual content.

## 📊 File Statistics

### Total Files Created
- **50 day files** in `src/data/days/`
- **1 main file** (`jobSearchData.ts`)
- **Total: 51 files**

### File Sizes
- **Days 1-30**: ~1,200-1,800 bytes each (detailed content)
- **Days 31-50**: ~250-300 bytes each (placeholder content)
- **Main file**: ~2,700 bytes (imports and exports)

### Lines of Code
- **Before**: 1,265 lines in one file
- **After**: ~30-50 lines per day file, 107 lines in main file
- **Total**: Similar total lines, but much better organized

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Import Structure
The main file imports all 50 days:
```typescript
import { day01 } from './days/day-01';
import { day02 } from './days/day-02';
// ... (50 imports total)
```

### Export Structure
All days are exported as a single array:
```typescript
export const jobSearchData: DayContent[] = [
  day01,
  day02,
  // ... (50 days total)
];
```

### Type Safety
- All day files use the `DayContent` type
- TypeScript ensures consistency
- Compile-time error checking

---

## ✅ Verification

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```
**Result**: ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings (127 files checked)

### File Count
```bash
ls src/data/days/ | wc -l
```
**Result**: ✅ 50 files

### Application Test
- ✅ Calendar displays all 50 days
- ✅ Detail pages load correctly
- ✅ Navigation works (Previous/Next)
- ✅ Progress tracking functions
- ✅ Congratulations page accessible

## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to edit `jobSearchData.ts`?**
A: No! Only edit the individual day files in `src/data/days/`

**Q: What if I want to add a new day?**
A: Create a new file (e.g., `day-51.ts`), then add it to the imports and array in `jobSearchData.ts`

**Q: Can I rename the day files?**
A: Not recommended. The naming convention (day-01.ts, day-02.ts, etc.) keeps things organized

**Q: How do I know which days need content?**
A: Days 1-30 are complete. Days 31-50 have placeholder content that needs to be replaced

**Q: What if I break something?**
A: Run `npm run lint` to check for errors. TypeScript will tell you exactly what's wrong
