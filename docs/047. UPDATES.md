## How to Add Content for Days 31-50

To add content for days 31-50, edit `/workspace/chasemycareer/src/data/jobSearchData.ts`:

1. Find the day you want to update (e.g., day 31)
2. Replace the placeholder content with:
   - `theme`: The day's title
   - `objective`: Today's main goal
   - `keyTasks`: Array of key tasks
   - `instructions`: Array of instruction objects with title and steps
   - `resources`: Array of resource objects with title and url
   - `timeCommitment`: Estimated time (e.g., "2-3 hours")
   - `proTip`: A helpful tip for the day

Example:
```typescript
{
  dayNumber: 31,
  theme: 'Your Theme Here',
  objective: 'Your objective here.',
  keyTasks: [
    'Task 1',
    'Task 2',
    'Task 3',
  ],
  instructions: [
    {
      title: 'Step 1 Title',
      steps: [
        'Step 1a',
        'Step 1b',
      ],
    },
  ],
