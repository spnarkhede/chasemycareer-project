**Function**: `create-demo-user`
- Creates/resets demo account
- Generates all sample data
- Handles data cleanup on reset
- Returns creation statistics

#### 2. Frontend Components
**New Files**:
- `src/hooks/useDemoProtection.ts` - Demo protection hook
- `src/components/common/DemoModeBanner.tsx` - Persistent banner
- `src/pages/admin/CreateDemoUser.tsx` - Admin utility

**Modified Files**:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added isDemoMode detection
- `src/App.tsx` - Integrated demo banner
- `src/pages/Landing.tsx` - Added View Demo button
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Added demo CTA card
- `src/pages/FiftyDayPlan.tsx` - Added read-only protection
- `src/pages/JobTracker.tsx` - Added read-only protection

#### 3. Demo Detection Logic
```typescript
// In AuthContext
const isDemoMode = user?.email === 'demo@chasemycareer.de';
```

#### 4. Protection Hook
```typescript
// Usage in components
const { checkDemoMode } = useDemoProtection();

const handleAction = () => {
  if (checkDemoMode('perform this action')) return;
  // ... proceed with action
};
```

## 🎨 Conversion Strategy

### Multiple Touchpoints
1. **Landing Page**: "View Demo" button (entry point)
2. **Dashboard**: Large CTA card (immediate, prominent)
3. **Persistent Banner**: Always visible (constant reminder)
4. **Toast Notifications**: On every blocked action (contextual)
5. **All CTAs**: Clear value proposition and easy access

### Messaging Strategy
- **Landing**: "View Demo" - Low commitment, high curiosity
- **Dashboard**: "Start Your Journey" - Aspirational, action-oriented
- **Banner**: "Track Your Progress" - Benefit-focused
- **Toasts**: "[Action] to save changes" - Feature-specific value

---

## 🛠️ Admin Tools

### Demo Reset Utility
**Location**: `/admin/create-demo-user`

**Features**:
- One-click demo data reset
- Detailed success feedback
- Error handling with clear messages
- Shows creation statistics

**Use Cases**:
- Initial setup
- Periodic data cleanup
- Testing and QA
- Demo corruption recovery

---

## 📈 Expected Impact

- [ ] Verify auto-login and redirect to dashboard
- [ ] Confirm demo CTA card appears on dashboard
- [ ] Check persistent banner on all pages
- [ ] Try marking task complete (should be blocked)
- [ ] Try adding job application (should be blocked)

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Read-Only Enforcement
- All mutations protected at component level
- Demo detection happens in AuthContext
- No database-level changes possible for demo user
- Edge Function uses service role for data management

### Data Isolation
- Demo data is separate from real user data
- Reset function only affects demo user
- No cross-contamination possible

---

## 📝 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Check demo data quality
2. **Monthly**: Reset demo data to ensure freshness
3. **Quarterly**: Review conversion metrics
4. **As Needed**: Update sample data to reflect new features

### Monitoring
- Track "View Demo" click rate
- Monitor demo-to-signup conversion rate
- Analyze which CTAs perform best
- Review demo session duration

---

## 🎉 Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- Demo view rate (% of landing page visitors)
- Demo-to-signup conversion rate
- Time spent in demo mode
- CTA click-through rates

### Secondary Metrics
- Pages viewed in demo mode
- Actions attempted (blocked operations)
