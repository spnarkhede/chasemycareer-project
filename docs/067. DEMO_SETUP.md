# Demo Mode Setup Instructions

## Overview
The demo mode feature allows visitors to explore the application without signing up, using a pre-populated demo account with sample data.

## Demo Account Credentials
- **Email**: demo@chasemycareer.de
- **Password**: DemoUser2024!

## Initial Setup (One-Time)

### Step 1: Create Demo User and Sample Data
Visit the admin page to initialize the demo account:
```
/admin/create-demo-user
```

This will:
- Create the demo user account (or reset if it already exists)
- Generate 10 completed tasks (Day 1-5, 2 tasks per day)
- Create 4 sample job applications
- Create 2 sample interviews
- Create 4 sample networking contacts
- Set user progress to Day 5

### Step 2: Verify Demo Mode
1. Log out of any existing account
2. Go to the landing page
3. Click "View Demo" button
4. You should be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard
5. Verify the demo banner appears at the top
6. Verify sample data is visible

## Demo Mode Features

### Read-Only Protection
Demo users cannot:
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Add, edit, or delete job applications
- Add, edit, or delete interviews
- Add, edit, or delete networking contacts
- Save notes or make any data changes

When attempting these actions, users see a toast notification:
> "Demo mode is read-only. Sign up to [action]!"

With a "Sign Up" button that redirects to `/signup`.

### Conversion CTAs
Demo users see prominent calls-to-action:
1. **Persistent Banner** (top of page, dismissible)
   - "You're viewing demo mode - Sign up to track your progress"
   - "Sign Up Now" button

2. **Dashboard CTA Card** (prominent, top of dashboard)
   - Explains demo mode
   - "Sign Up Free - Start Your Journey" button
   - "Already Have an Account?" button

### Sample Data Included
- **Progress**: Day 5, 10 tasks completed
- **Applications**: 4 job applications (various statuses)
- **Interviews**: 2 upcoming interviews
- **Contacts**: 4 networking contacts

## Resetting Demo Data
To reset the demo account to its initial state:
1. Visit `/admin/create-demo-user`
2. Click "Create/Reset Demo User"
3. Wait for success confirmation

This will delete all existing demo data and recreate the sample dataset.
