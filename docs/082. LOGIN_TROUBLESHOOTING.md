## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

1. Press `F12` to open developer tools
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for these messages:

**Good signs (login working):**
```
Form submitted with email: user@example.com
Calling authApi.signIn...
Starting sign-in process for: user@example.com
Calling Supabase auth...
Sign-in successful, recording session...
Sign-in complete, returning user
Navigating to dashboard...
```

**Bad signs (login failing):**
```
Failed to get client IP: [error]
Rate limit check error: [error]
Sign-in error: [error]
Failed to record session: [error]
```

### Step 2: Check Network Tab

1. Press `F12` to open developer tools
2. Click "Network" tab
3. Try logging in
4. Look for failed requests (red)

**Common issues:**
- `api.ipify.org` - Timeout or failed (not critical)
- `supabase.co` - Failed (critical - check internet)
- `check_rate_limit` - Failed (not critical)
- `signInWithPassword` - Failed (critical - check credentials)

### Step 3: Check Application Tab

1. Press `F12` to open developer tools
2. Click "Application" tab
3. Look at "Local Storage"
4. Check for authentication tokens

**What to look for:**

- If missing, login didn't complete
- If present, you're logged in
