# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Chase My Career

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

This guide will help you run the Chase My Career application locally.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Supabase account (free tier works)
- Git installed

---

## Step 1: Environment Setup

### 1.1 Navigate to Frontend Directory
```bash
cd /workspace/chasemycareer/frontend
```

### 1.2 Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 1.3 Configure Environment Variables

The `.env` file should already exist with Supabase credentials. Verify it contains:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id (optional)
```

---

## Step 2: Database Verification

### 2.1 Check Database Tables

All migrations should already be applied. Verify by checking Supabase dashboard:

**Required Tables:**
- ✅ profiles
- ✅ daily_tasks
- ✅ daily_tasks_template (with 50 days)
- ✅ job_applications
- ✅ interviews
- ✅ networking_contacts
- ✅ documents
- ✅ admin_users
- ✅ user_messages
- ✅ user_activity
- ✅ achievements

### 2.2 Verify 50-Day Curriculum

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_days 
FROM daily_tasks_template;
```

Should return: `total_days: 50`

---

## Step 3: Run the Application

### 3.1 Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3.2 Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

You should see the "Chase My Career" landing page.

---

## Step 4: Create Your First User

### 4.1 Sign Up

1. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
2. Enter your email and password
3. Fill in your full name
4. Click "Create Account"

### 4.2 Verify Task Creation

After registration, 50 daily tasks should be automatically created for you.

Check in Supabase:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as my_tasks 
FROM daily_tasks 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

Should return: `my_tasks: 50`

---

## Step 5: Create an Admin User

### 5.1 Get Your User ID

After logging in, check the browser console or Supabase dashboard for your user ID.

### 5.2 Make Yourself Admin

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace 'your-user-id-here' with your actual user ID
INSERT INTO admin_users (user_id, role, permissions)
VALUES (
  'your-user-id-here',
  'admin',
  '{"view_users": true, "edit_users": true, "delete_users": false, "send_messages": true}'::jsonb
);
```

### 5.3 Access Admin Dashboard

Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173/admin/dashboard
```

You should see the admin dashboard with user statistics.

---

## Step 6: Test Core Features

### 6.1 User Dashboard
- ✅ View your 50-day plan
- ✅ Add a job application
- ✅ Schedule an interview
- ✅ Add a networking contact

### 6.2 Admin Dashboard (if admin)
- ✅ View all users
- ✅ Check statistics
- ✅ Send a test message to yourself

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution:**
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Issue 2: Database connection errors
**Solution:**
- Verify `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
- Check Supabase project is active
- Verify API keys are correct

### Issue 3: No tasks created after registration
**Solution:**
- Check if `daily_tasks_template` has 50 rows
- Verify trigger is enabled:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'trigger_auto_initialize_tasks';
```

### Issue 4: Admin dashboard shows "Access denied"
**Solution:**
- Verify you added yourself to `admin_users` table
- Check the user_id matches your auth user ID
- Log out and log back in

### Issue 5: Google OAuth not working
**Solution:**
- Google OAuth requires valid client ID
- For local testing, you can skip OAuth and use email/password
- To enable: Get Google OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
