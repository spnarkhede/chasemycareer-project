- Text: `text-muted-foreground` (gray)
- Opacity: `opacity-60` (60% opacity)

**Unlocked State:**

## 📱 Responsive Design

The Congratulations Card adapts to all screen sizes:

- **Mobile (2 columns)**: Card appears in grid naturally
- **Tablet (3-4 columns)**: Card fits in grid layout
- **Desktop (5-7 columns)**: Card appears after Day 50

The card uses the same grid system as day cards, ensuring consistent layout across all devices.

---

## 🔒 Access Control Logic

### Blocking Mechanism

```typescript
const allDaysCompleted = completedDays.size === 50;

// Card click handler
onClick={() => allDaysCompleted && onCongratulationsClick()}

// Conditional styling
className={`${
  allDaysCompleted
    ? 'cursor-pointer hover:scale-105 ...'  // Unlocked
    : 'cursor-not-allowed opacity-60 ...'   // Locked
}`}
```

### Progress Tracking

The card shows real-time progress:
- Reads from `completedDays` Set
- Displays "X/50 days" when locked
- Automatically unlocks when `completedDays.size === 50`
