- ⏳ Complete branding update

## 📊 Implementation Strategy

### Strategy Decision: Hybrid Approach
Given that we already have a working Supabase setup with authentication and database, we'll:

1. **Keep Supabase** for:
   - Authentication (already working with Google OAuth)
   - PostgreSQL database (more powerful than D1)
   - File storage (resumes, cover letters)
   - Real-time features

2. **Skip Cloudflare D1** because:
   - Supabase PostgreSQL is already set up
   - More features than D1 (triggers, functions, RLS)
   - Better for complex queries
   - Already has admin tables created

3. **Focus on**:
   - Completing 50-day curriculum population
   - Building admin dashboard UI
   - Enhancing user dashboard
   - Adding missing features (resume builder, etc.)
